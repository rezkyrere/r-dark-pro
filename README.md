# R Dark Pro
R Dark Pro is a color scheme, customized user interface theme and complete icon set for Visual Studio Code. It has been designed by the Rezky P. Budihartono.

## Apply theme

To apply theme, it's so simple. Just open your command palette and type "settings.json". Then you can add the theme like so

```json
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "R Dark Pro (Filter Synthwave)",
    // ...
}
```

## Contribute

I also opened the repo on [github](https://github.com/rezkyrere/r-dark-pro), so for those of you who want to make the theme more robust, or add support for other languages, you can directly make a pull request.

**Enjoy!**
